## Living & Non-Living Things: A Mind Map

**Central Idea:** Characteristics of Living & Non-Living Things

**Branches:**

**1.  Living Things**

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Growth:** Increase in size and complexity (e.g., seedling to tree, tadpole to frog)
    *   **Reproduction:** Creating offspring (e.g., laying eggs, bearing live young)
    *   **Nutrition:** Obtaining and processing food for energy (e.g., photosynthesis, eating)
    *   **Respiration:** Converting energy from food into usable forms (e.g., breathing)
    *   **Movement:** Internal (e.g., blood flow) and external (e.g., walking, flying)
    *   **Excretion:** Removing waste products (e.g., sweating, urination)
    *   **Sensitivity:** Responding to stimuli in the environment (e.g., light, touch)
    *   **Made of Cells:**  Basic building blocks of all living organisms (can be unicellular or multicellular)

*   **Examples:**
    *   Plants (trees, flowers, grass)
    *   Animals (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects)
    *   Fungi (mushrooms, molds)
    *   Bacteria 
    *   Protists (algae, amoeba)

**2. Non-Living Things**

*   **Characteristics:**
    *   **Do Not Grow:** May change size or shape due to external factors but don't grow internally
    *   **Do Not Reproduce:**  Cannot create offspring 
    *   **Do Not Need Nutrition:** Do not require food for energy
    *   **Do Not Respire:** Do not exchange gases for energy conversion
    *   **Movement is Usually External:** Caused by forces like wind, water, or gravity
    *   **Do Not Excrete:**  Do not produce waste products internally
    *   **Limited Sensitivity:** May react to some stimuli (e.g., metal expanding with heat) but lack complex responses
    *   **Not Made of Cells:** Composed of elements, minerals, or synthetic materials

*   **Examples:**
    *   Rocks
    *   Water
    *   Air
    *   Sunlight
    *   Man-made objects (cars, buildings, books)

**Connecting Ideas:**

*   **Interactions:** Living things depend on non-living things for survival (e.g., plants need sunlight, water, and air).
*   **Gray Areas:** Viruses are difficult to classify definitively as living or non-living, blurring the lines between the two categories.

**Further Exploration:**

*   **Specific Examples:** Dive deeper into the characteristics of specific living and non-living things.
*   **Ecosystems:** Explore how living and non-living things interact within different environments.
*   **Cells:** Learn about the different types of cells and their functions in living organisms.

This mind map provides a framework for understanding the key differences between living and non-living things.  You can add more branches, sub-branches, and details to personalize it further.
